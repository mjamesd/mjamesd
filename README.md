# Mark Drummond, ✨Software Engineer and Full Stack Web Developer✨

## Current Role: Software Engineer
I am a Software Engineer for the CASCADIA Study at the University of Washington. I supplement REDCap functionality with PHP code through its API to ensure a smooth and sane digital experience of participants in clinical trials and research studies as well as data analysts and principal investigators. I maintain and update study participant and specimen tracking dashboards. I consult on technical feasibility of projects and implementation timelines. I build REDCap projects that utilize its advanced features. I push REDCap's boundaries while balancing study participants' user experience with the needs of research staff, lab scientists, data analysts, and funders. I set up ETL pipelines, automate study processes, and create self-serve websites for study staff to print barcodes, perform QC, produce datasets, and present reports.

## Web Developer for Hire
I'm a full stack web developer with independent, freelance, and team development experience. I've created single-page apps, mobile-responsive web apps, WordPress sites, Drupal sites, full-stack React apps with the MERN stack with GraphQL, and full-stack PHP MVC CMSs for clients big and small.

I have been passionate about web development since I was a teenager. I began teaching myself to code when I was 15 and was proficient in C, Bash, HTML, CSS, PHP & MySQL by the time I graduated high school. In college, I took on a few small clients and worked as a web developer at two small businesses. When I moved to Seattle, I established a career in and passion for public health but always missed the creativity and problem solving of web development. As soon as I had the resources, I pursued a certificate in full stack web development through the University of Washington. Now that I’ve earned the certificate, I am excited to pursue this career again. I am seeking employment as a front end, back end, or full stack web developer and look forward to working with you. Please view [my portfolio](http://www.markdrummond.me) (last updated September 2024) for examples of my past and current projects. I look forward to working with you!

## About Me
I researched and procured components to build a PC from scratch when I was 14. I taught myself Debian Linux system administration on the command line, then began teaching myself to code. I then taught myself Apache configuration and ran a web and email server out of my bedroom in my parents' house. I learned HTML, CSS, a little JavaScript, and a lot of PHP from tutorials before YouTube was created. I tested myself by building a website that was basically Facebook before Facebook was created. My friends and I would post updates and comment on each other's posts. It supported infinitely-nested comments, image uploads, and user profiles.

During university, I took on a few small clients, contracted with a development firm, and worked at two small businesses as a web developer. I graduated and fell out of the development field to pursue other passions. Now I've earned a certificate in full stack web development through the University of Washington and am _very_ excited to pursue this career again.

I am seeking employment as a web developer – front end, back end, or full stack. Contact me today to discuss your next website!
