# Mark Drummond &mdash; âœ¨Full-Stack Web Developerâœ¨

## Web Developer for Hire
I'm a full-stack web developer with independent, freelance, and team development experience. I've created single-page apps, mobile-responsive web apps, WordPress sites, Drupal sites, and custom full-stack LAMP MVC CMSs. I create responsive websites and content management systems for clients big and small. I want to work with your farmer's market stand, small business, university department, or development firm to create a meaningful product that meets yours and your customers' needs. Contact me today to discuss your next website!

## About Me
I researched and procured components to build a PC from scratch when I was 14. I taught myself Debian Linux system administration on the command line, then began teaching myself to code. I then taught myself Apache configuration and ran a web and email server out of my bedroom in my parents' house. I learned HTML, CSS, a little JavaScript, and a lot of PHP from tutorials before YouTube was created. I tested myself by building a website that was basically Facebook before Facebook was created. My friends and I would post updates and comment on each other's posts. It supported infinitely-nested comments, image uploads, and user profiles.

During university, I took on a few small clients, contracted with a development firm, and worked at two small businesses as a web developer. I graduated and fell out of the development field to pursue other passions. Now I'm working towards a certificate in full-stack web development through the University of Washington and am _very_ excited to pursue this career again.

I am seeking employment as a web developer â€“ frontend, back-end, or full-stack. Please view [my portfolio](https://mjamesd.github.io/portfolio/) (last updated January 2022) for examples of my past and current projects. I look forward to working with you!
